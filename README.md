# BreachNotifier

**BreachNotifier** is a tool designed to monitor data breaches associated with a list of email addresses. It leverages services like **LeakCheck** to verify data leaks, can log results for SIEM tools (e.g., Wazuh), and sends notifications to systems like **TheHive**. This project is built to be extensible, modular, and easily configurable.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Automatically checks for email data breaches using the LeakCheck API.
- Modular architecture: interchangeable loggers and notifiers.
- Sends notifications to **TheHive** with detailed breach alerts.
- Logs results for SIEM tools like **Wazuh**.
- Tracks breach state to only detect new compromises.
- Simple configuration via a YAML file.

---
